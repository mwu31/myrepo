# An Introduction About Me!
## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Marlina Wu. I am a rising senior in high school at **Walter Payton College Prep**. My favorite subject in school is biology! In the future, I'd like to conduct meaningful scientific research that advances humanity's quality of life!     

### Here are some fun facts about me:  
- I play violin, viola, and piano.
  - My favorite out of these is the violin because its sound is the closest to a human voice.  
  - Some say the violin can sound like a mother's cries.   
  - I'd also argue playing instruments can ~~sometimes~~ feel like a sport.   
    - Did you know you can burn up to **200** calories an hour?!  

- I have one older brother and one younger sister.  

- I've had glasses since I was three.  
  - I got them after failing a *preschool* vision exam.
